        <div class="textbox">
<p>I'm Red Robin, not related to the restaraunt chain. I'm the third person to have the Robin identity--and the best one in my opinion. My predecessors wish they were as good at their job as me. I am a former member of Young Justice and the Teen Titans. Although other people have had the identity of Red Robin, the current version (me) is the most well-known for the hero name. I am featured in multiple comic series within the DC universe as a side character and have my own serialized comics where I star as the main character which is currently ongoing. My first appearance was in Batman #436 in 1989. I regularly defeat and put away the local bad guys of Gotham, including the Joker, The Riddler, and Two-Face. When I'm not doing detective work and putting criminals behind bars, I'm doing regular people activities and not much else.</p> 
    <p>What, did you think I'd reveal anything that could give hints to my identity in a blog?</p>

<p class="easteregg">He is definitely not the best Robin.</p>
<p class="easteregg">Yeah, he's not even the most famous <i>Red Robin</i>. That's the burger chain.</p>
<p class="easteregg">The best Robin was obviously me: Nightwing.</p>
<p class="easteregg">Um actually, it was me? Red Hood is way more awesome than Nightwing.</p>
<p class="easteregg">More like way more emo.</p>
