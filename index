        Bio Blurb</h2>
        <p>Red Robin, not related to the restaraunt chain. I'm the third person to have the Robin identity--and the best one in my opinion. My predecessors wish they were as good at their job as me. I am a former member of Young Justice and the Teen Titans. Although other people have had the identity of Red Robin, the current version (me) is the most well-known for the hero name. I am featured in multiple comic series within the DC universe as a side character and have my own serialized comics where I star as the main character which is currently ongoing. My first appearance was in Batman #436 in 1989. I regularly defeat and put away the local bad guys of Gotham, including the Joker, The Riddler, and Two-Face. When I'm not doing detective work and putting criminals behind bars, I'm doing regular people activities and not much else. What, did you think I'd reveal anything that could give hints to my identity in a blog? </p>
